What We're Looking For
What's your style?? How do you approach this project?? Do you bang it out in 20 lines and console logs or do you code an elaborate dance among the
asynchronous jungle to deliver a symphony?? Expect that the phone interview will involve talking about the choices you made.
Tabs or spaces?
How do you want the output to look?- if you have a lot of time and want to show off your CSS/HTML skills give us a create-react-app repo with a full
front end.? Have less time? console.log out that data - this isn't about scoring bonus points with us, it's about showing us you know the bare minimum and
giving us something to chat about during the subsequent phone interview.
How long will this take?-?that totally depends on you.? We think an estimate for something that matches the requirements above will be about 45 - 60
minutes.? Doing above and beyond is on you.
Can I use NPM repos - if that's what you'd like to do - have at it; just be ready to explain why you chose one repo over another or why you used one at all.
